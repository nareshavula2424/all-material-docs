1.what is spring framework ?

=> Spring framework is powerful,light-weight and opensource framework for java development.
=> it provides comprehensive support for developing java applications, particularly enterprise-level
   applications
=> it simplifies the java development by providing features like DI,AOP,Transaction management and integration with various frameworks.

2.what is springboot, and how it is different from spring framework ?

=> spring boot is an extension of spring framework by providing auto-configuration, embaded servers and convention-
    over - configuration approch.

   SPRING FRAMEWORK                       VS                        SPRING BOOT:
-> configuration - requires XML/ java based                     -> Uses auto configuration
                   config

-> server-setup - Need an external server                       -> By default comes with embaded server
                  (Tomcat,Jetty)

-> dependency
   management  - manual dependency handling                     -> Uses spring boot starters for dependency


3.what is @SpringBootApplication, and what does it do ?

=> @SpringBootApplication is composite annotation that combines
  @Configuration -> it used to define beans in spring
  @EnableAutoConfiguration -> Automatically configures beans based on the dependencies(Ex.,if spring-boot-starter-web is present, it configures an Embaded Tomcat Server,DispatcherServlet,Jackson (for JSON processing)) 
  =>if SpringDataJPA is present , springboot auto configures 
        * Datasource
        * EntityManager
        * TransactionManager

  @ComponetScan -> Scans component like (@Service,@Controller,@Repository)


4.what is Dependency Injection in spring boot ?
=> Dependency Injection in springboot is design pattern spring automatically injects dependencies into components,
  avoid manual instantation.

  why use DI ?
  -> Removes tight coupling 
  -> Enhances testability
  -> Improves Maintainbility

5. what is circular dependency ?
